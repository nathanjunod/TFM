# ADGRE2 Domain Architecture Visualization

This repository provides a Python script (via Google Colab) to visualize the annotated domain structure of the human adhesion G protein–coupled receptor ADGRE2 (UniProt: Q9UHX3).

## 🧬 Protein Overview

ADGRE2 (also known as EMR2) is an adhesion GPCR expressed on myeloid cells. Its extracellular domain contains five EGF-like repeats, including several Ca²⁺-binding motifs, and a conserved GAIN/GPS domain involved in proteolytic cleavage and activation. This protein is implicated in inflammatory responses and diseases such as vibratory urticaria.

## 📊 What the Script Does

- Visualizes the linear domain architecture of ADGRE2
- Annotates key domains: EGF-like repeats, GAIN domain, and GPS region
- Highlights each domain with a unique color and position on the protein
- Labels amino acid positions every 100 residues
- Customizes font sizes for publication-quality output

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3
- `matplotlib`

To run in a web environment, use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## 📁 Files Included

- `adgre2_domain_script.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook with plotting code
- `README.md`: This file

## 📜 Citation

If you use this visualization in a publication, please consider citing the UniProt entry for ADGRE2 and relevant structural biology literature.
